## 📋 Development Status

This is currently maintained entirely by me, an animator and brand designer with next to no experience with building tools. This has been vibe-coded into existence using GitHub Copilot in VScode, using mostly Claude Sonnet 4, with the occasional GPT-5 when Claude gets stumped. Please forgive any messy or unusal structure or vibe-code artifacts, I'm trying my best!

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions to the **open-source core** (`packages/core/`)!

### For Open Source Contributors

**What you can contribute:**
- ✅ New drawing tools and brushes
- ✅ Animation features and effects
- ✅ Export formats and converters
- ✅ UI/UX improvements
- ✅ Bug fixes and performance optimizations
- ✅ Documentation and examples

**What is proprietary:**
- ❌ Authentication system (`packages/premium/`)
- ❌ Cloud storage features
- ❌ Payment integration

### Monorepo Setup for Contributors

**Important:** This project uses a monorepo structure with a private Git submodule for premium features.

#### Project Structure
```
Ascii-Motion/               # Main repository (public)
├── packages/
│   ├── core/              # Open source (MIT) - You work here!
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── stores/
│   │   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   │   └── utils/
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── premium/           # Private submodule (Proprietary)
│       └── (not accessible to contributors)
├── src/                   # Legacy code (being migrated to core)
└── package.json           # Root workspace config
```

#### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cameronfoxly/Ascii-Motion.git
   cd Ascii-Motion
   npm install
   ```

2. **The `packages/premium/` folder will be empty** - This is expected! You don't need it to contribute.

3. **All your work happens in `packages/core/`:**
   ```bash
   # Core package has its own dev server
   cd packages/core
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Development workflow:**
   - Make changes in `packages/core/src/`
   - The dev server will hot-reload your changes
   - Test thoroughly before submitting PR
   - Follow existing code patterns and TypeScript conventions

#### Import Paths

When writing code in `packages/core/`, use these import patterns:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct - Importing from core package
import { Button } from '@ascii-motion/core/components';
import { useCanvas } from '@ascii-motion/core/hooks';
import { CanvasStore } from '@ascii-motion/core/stores';

// ❌ Incorrect - Don't import from premium
import { AuthContext } from '@ascii-motion/premium/auth';
```

#### What Happens to Premium Code?

- The main app (`src/` folder) imports from both `core` and `premium`
- When you run `npm run dev` from the root, both packages are built
- **If `packages/premium/` is missing,** the app will still work but without auth/cloud features
- Your contributions to `core` are completely independent of premium features

#### Testing Your Changes

```bash
# Test from core package (recommended for contributors)
cd packages/core
npm run dev        # Opens Storybook or component sandbox
npm run test       # Run unit tests
npm run lint       # Check code style

# Test in full app (optional)
cd ../..           # Back to root
npm run dev        # Runs full app (may show warnings about missing premium)
```

#### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-tool`
3. Make your changes in `packages/core/`
4. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m "Add gradient brush tool"`
5. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/amazing-tool`
6. Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch

**PR Checklist:**
- [ ] Changes are only in `packages/core/` (no premium code)
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and TypeScript conventions
- [ ] Tests pass (`npm run test`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`npm run lint`)
